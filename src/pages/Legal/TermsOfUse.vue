					Welcome to Kiva Microfunds, a California non-profit public benefit corporation (together with its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, representatives, partners and their respective affiliates, collectively, "Kiva"). This Terms of Use ("Agreement") is a contract between you ("you") and Kiva and governs your access and use of the kiva.org website and all other websites and mobile apps owned and operated by Kiva that have this Agreement posted (collectively, the "Website"), including, but not limited to, all transactions conducted on the Website and all Kiva services provided in connection with the Website. By accessing or using the Website, you signify that you have read all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, this Agreement (including the <a href="https://www.kiva.org/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>), and you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether or not you participate in Kiva's microlending program or related programs, services or activities (collectively, the "Program") or otherwise access or use the Website (in each such capacity, a "User"). If you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, please do not participate in the Program or access or use the Website.

					This Agreement supersedes any previous agreement to which you and Kiva may have been bound (provided that if you are a Borrower, Trustee, Field Partner or Lender who has a separate written agreement with Kiva, the terms of that separate agreement will control with respect to any provision that conflicts with this Agreement). This Agreement may be modified by Kiva in its sole discretion from time to time and such modifications shall automatically become part of this Agreement and shall be effective once posted by Kiva on the Website (as indicated by the posted update date). Your participation in the Program and use of the Website will be subject to any such modifications. You should review the Website and this Agreement from time to time for any modifications. If you do not agree with any such modifications, please immediately terminate your registered Kiva account, if any, as outlined in Section 8 below, and please immediately stop participating in the Program and accessing and using the Website.

						Kiva manages the Website, which matches you and other persons (each, a "Lender" and, collectively, "Lenders") with borrowers and social enterprises in various countries in need of affordable capital (each, a "Borrower" and, collectively, "Borrowers"). In most instances, these Borrowers are considered "high risk" by traditional lenders for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Borrowers' lack of credit history, the use of the loan proceeds for entrepreneurial endeavors including investment in a "start up" business, and the geographic location including the risk of financial instability and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Please carefully review the Website section entitled "The risks of lending" which highlights the various risks associated with lending online through Kiva and explains in greater detail the role played by Kiva and its Field Partners and Trustees (each defined below in this Section 1).

						<strong>Basically,</strong><br>
						This section describes what Kiva does. Lending on Kiva is risky and you might not get repaid what you lend. Please read our page called “<a href="https://www.kiva.org/about/due-diligence/risk">The risks of lending</a>” for more information on the different types of risk you assume when you make a loan.

					<p>
						You may participate in the Program as a Lender by creating an online account on the Website registered to your email address, or by using a guest checkout feature, as described below in Section 1.2. If you participate via Kiva's mobile app, you may not have access to all Website features and functionality through the app; however, you can access all your account settings, functionality, and information about your lending history through Kiva’s website at kiva.org. All transactions between Lenders and Borrowers or Field Partners (“Loans”) must be conducted through a Kiva account, except when making a guest Loan. Technically speaking, there is no direct contractual relationship between you and the Field Partners or Borrowers designated to receive your funds, and Kiva may, in certain circumstances, be considered the "lender" on your behalf when you make Loans on the Website. The funds you have available in your Kiva account which are freely available to be lent – whether deposited from your personal funds, value from a Kiva Card (as defined below in Section 1.12), or repayments on previously made Loans – are referred to as your "Kiva Credit." If you make a Loan through the Website, whether manually or via Kiva’s Auto-Lending feature (as defined below), you are instructing Kiva to apply your Kiva Credit to fund a Borrower and/or Field Partner through the Website. All amounts deposited in your Kiva account must be lent through the Website and/or donated to Kiva. If Kiva receives repayments on your Loans from the applicable Borrowers/Field Partners, such repayment amounts will not be returned to your Kiva account unless and until you instruct Kiva to apply suchh amounts toward another Loan. Alternatively, you can request that Kiva pay you an amount equivalent to such repayments by requesting a withdrawal. You must have both a Kiva account and a PayPal account to receive and withdraw repayments. Please note that PayPal does not facilitate payments in all countries - if PayPal does not allow payments to be received in your country, you will not be able to withdraw your funds.

						<strong>Basically,</strong><br>
						<span>You have to create an account to lend on Kiva, unless you check out as a guest. Money added to your account is called “Kiva credit” and it must be used to make loans on Kiva or donate to Kiva. As borrowers repay, you can relend the money or Kiva can pay you back. You need to have both a Kiva account and a PayPal account to withdraw payments from Kiva.</span>

Loans made via the Website are philanthropic in nature with no offered rate of return and, as such, are not intended as, and cannot be considered as, an investment in a financial instrument or security.

						Again, lending on Kiva is risky! That means you should only lend money that you can afford to lose. Once you’ve made a loan, you can’t cancel it, and Kiva doesn’t guarantee that it will be repaid. You also won’t earn interest on Kiva loans.

						Kiva will hold amounts due and payable to Lenders, Field Partners and Borrowers (including Kiva Credit) separate from Kiva’s general funds, in an account or accounts established to hold funds for the benefit of Users with funds in the Kiva system (“User Funds Account”). Kiva will not use such amounts for Kiva’s general operating expenses; however, Kiva reserves the right to retain (a) interest on funds while such funds are held in a User Funds Account and (b) any foreign exchange gains collected in connection with Loan repayments, and to use such interest and gains in support of Kiva’s general operating expenses.

						<strong>1.1<span class="long-tab"></span>Lending Through Kiva’s Website.</strong> The Website displays Loan requests from Borrowers seeking funding from Kiva Lenders. You can log into your Kiva account and manually fund specific Loan requests on the Website. Alternatively, you can let Kiva automatically apply your Kiva Credit toward Loans (“Auto-Lend”) based on preferences in your account settings. Unless you instruct Kiva not to Auto-Lend from your account, up to the full balance of your Kiva Credit may be Auto-Lent if the following circumstances are met: (a) you have not manually made a Loan for at least 45 days prior; (b) there are available Loan requests on the Website that meet the criteria you have designated in your account settings, if applicable; and (c) your Kiva account either (i) contains at least the minimum amount of Kiva Credit required to make a Loan manually, or (ii) no future repayments to your account are expected (in which case amounts less than the minimum manual Loan amount may be Auto-Lent). When you make a Loan, Kiva may ask you to simultaneously make a small donation to support Kiva’s operations; by default you will make a donation to Kiva with each Auto-Loan. You may change your account settings to, for example, give Kiva the option to Auto-Lend your Kiva Credit without waiting at least 45 days, designate criteria for the types of Loans to be automatically made from your Kiva Account, or change the amount of the donation made to Kiva with each Auto-Loan. If you do not designate Loan criteria for Auto-Lending in your account settings, Kiva may apply your funds toward any available Loan request. Unless you opt-out of Auto-Lending, any and all available Kiva Credit in your account, including amounts from repayments on your previous Loans, may be automatically applied toward Loans and accompanying donations to Kiva. However, you understand and acknowledge that Kiva shall have no obligation to lend your Kiva Credit via Auto-Lending at any particular time, or at all. You acknowledge and agree that any Loans transacted pursuant to Auto-Lending are in all respects Loans voluntarily made by you as the Lender, and in no event will such Loans be cancellable or refundable to you. Kiva may modify or terminate the Auto-Lending functionality at any time or from time to time.

						You can choose specific loans to make through Kiva’s website. If you do not lend your Kiva credit yourself, Kiva will automatically lend it for you (unless you tell us not to).

					<span>From time to time, Kiva may offer a guest checkout feature that allows you to make one or more Loans through the Website without creating a Kiva account. If you make a Loan through a guest checkout feature, you will need to provide your email address, and you will still be subject to Kiva’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. You agree that Kiva may contact you via email at the email address you provide when checking out as a guest. You understand and agree that you will not be able to receive or withdraw Loan repayment amounts if you do not have a Kiva account. From time to time, Kiva may allow you to “claim” your guest Loan(s) by enabling you to finish creating a Kiva account associated with the email address you provided when checking out as a guest. Kiva reserves the right to set time limits on when you must finish creating your Kiva account in order to claim a guest Loan. You agree that Kiva shall have sole discretion to use as Kiva sees fit any and all funds that are repaid on any Loan you make as a guest and do not later claim within the time period set by Kiva.</span>

				<strong>1.3<span class="long-tab"></span>Types of Loans on the Website.</strong>
			</p>

			<div class="row summary-row">
				<div class="small-12 xlarge-8 columns">
					<p>
						<strong>a.<span class="extra-long-tab"></span>Partner Loans.</strong> The majority of Loans on the Website are administered by existing domestic and international organizations (each, a "Field Partner" and, collectively, "Field Partners") that work in underbanked or low-income communities and generally have a stated mission to reduce poverty by providing affordable working capital, services or supplies to underbanked or low-income borrowers (“Partner Loans”). When a Partner Loan is funded, Kiva sends Lender funds to the Field Partner administering the Partner Loan, and receives Borrower repayments via the Field Partner as the Loan is repaid.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="small-12 xlarge-4 columns">
					<svg class="icon arrow"><use xlink:href="#icon-small-chevron" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" /></svg>
					<p>
						<strong>Basically,</strong><br>
						Most loans on Kiva’s website are posted by third-party organizations we call “Field Partners.” Field Partners disburse money to borrowers and collect repayments, which they then send to Kiva.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row summary-row">
				<div class="small-12 xlarge-8 columns">
					<p>
						<strong>b.<span class="extra-long-tab"></span>Direct Loans.</strong> Certain other Loans on the Website are not administered by Field Partners, but instead are made by transferring funds directly from Kiva to a Borrower’s digital account (“Direct Loans”). Because Direct Loans are not managed by a Field Partner, they typically bear a greater risk of non-repayment than most Partner Loans. As Direct Loans are repaid, funds are then transferred directly from the Borrower’s account back to Kiva. Some, but not all, Direct Loans are endorsed by individuals or institutions that vouch for the Borrower’s character (“Trustees”). Trustees may help manage their respective Borrowers’ relationships with Kiva, but Trustees do not handle Loan disbursements or repayments made through Kiva’s system, and they do not guarantee Borrower repayments. Direct Loans and Partner Loans differ in some important ways, which will be explained more below.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="small-12 xlarge-4 columns">
					<svg class="icon arrow"><use xlink:href="#icon-small-chevron" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" /></svg>
					<p>
						<strong>Basically,</strong><br>
						A few loans on Kiva’s website are posted and managed by Kiva without any assistance from a Field Partner – we call these “direct loans.” In general, direct loans have a higher risk of non-repayment than Field Partner loans because there’s no third-party institution managing the loan. Some direct loans are endorsed by “Trustees,” which are people or institutions that vouch for the borrower’s character but do not actually handle the loan.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>
				<strong>1.4<span class="long-tab"></span>Loan Disbursement.</strong>
			</p>

			<div class="row summary-row">
				<div class="small-12 xlarge-8 columns">
					<p>
						<strong>a.<span class="extra-long-tab"></span>Partner Loan Disbursement.</strong> Partner Loans are not made directly to Borrowers, but are instead administered by Field Partners. Loan requests are posted in cooperation with such Field Partners and are, before being listed on Kiva, converted to U.S. dollar amounts as necessary and then rounded up to the nearest U.S. dollar increment of 25, to help streamline the Loan transaction process. Funds loaned by you, the Lender, will be delivered to Field Partners for ultimate disbursement to, or backfilling of Loans to, the Borrower(s). In certain cases, Borrowers may receive goods and services funded by Loan amounts, such as agricultural packages, from Field Partners, instead of the monetary amount of the Loan. A Field Partner may voluntarily choose to pre-fund your Borrower in the short-term from its own funds in anticipation of receiving your Loan amounts as backfill. This helps reduce the time the Borrower needs to wait until the Loan is funded on the Website and the funds are delivered to the Field Partner. Kiva serves as a middle-man in the process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and delivers 100% of these funds on a net billing basis (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a User Funds Account, which interest is contributed toward funding Kiva's operations) to the Field Partner(s) for disbursement to the Borrowers funded through the Website. Please note that many Field Partners require mandatory savings as part of their transaction process to serve as collateral, which savings may help ensure that Borrowers are able to accumulate cash and represent a good risk. In certain cases, mandatory savings (and fees) are netted by Field Partners against the Loans forwarded by Kiva.
					</p>

					<p>
						The process of disbursement to a Borrower in a particular country, however, may vary from the standard disbursement structure just described. Currency and other national or local regulations may require a different philanthropic funding structure in some countries. In such cases, instead of Loan funds being forwarded directly to the corresponding Field Partner, Kiva may, for example, have to transact with other intermediaries (such as the Field Partner's U.S.-based affiliates or other third parties licensed in the particular country to transact in foreign currencies) to structure a different indirect funding process that enables a Borrower to ultimately be supported by a Partner Loan from you. In some cases, Kiva may approve a Field Partner's pledge of collateral to another lender that may include loans supported by Kiva Users.
					</p>

				<div class="small-12 xlarge-4 columns">
					<svg class="icon arrow"><use xlink:href="#icon-small-chevron" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" /></svg>
					<p>
						<strong>Basically,</strong><br>
						This section explains how we get your money to borrowers. Most loans are distributed to borrowers through Kiva’s Field Partners. Kiva works with lots of different types of Field Partners and borrowers in different countries, so the process of loan distribution can vary depending on the loan.
					</p>
				</div>

			<div class="row summary-row">
				<div class="small-12 xlarge-8 columns">

						Field Partners are solely responsible for screening and selecting each Borrower (including, without limitation, posting requests for Partner Loans on the Website) and making all Partner Loan disbursements, and Kiva expressly disclaims any responsibility to screen or select any Borrower or any Field Partner or monitor the disbursement of Loan proceeds from the Field Partner(s) to the Borrower(s). Kiva and its Field Partners shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such screening or selection of Borrowers or Field Partners and the disbursement of Loan proceeds from the Field Partner(s) to the Borrower(s), and you shall hold Kiva and its Field Partners harmless from any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from such screenings, selections and disbursements.

			<div class="row summary-row">

						<strong>b.<span class="extra-long-tab"></span>Direct Loan Disbursement.</strong> Direct Loans are made directly to Borrowers, without facilitation by Field Partners. Direct Loan requests are submitted by Borrowers and approved by Kiva before they are posted to the Website. Funds loaned by you, the Lender, will be transferred directly to the account of the Borrower you have chosen to support. Kiva serves as a middle-man in the process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and delivers 100% of these funds (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a User Funds Account, which interest is contributed toward funding Kiva's operations) to the Borrower. Kiva expressly disclaims any responsibility to screen Trustees or Borrowers or monitor Borrowers’ use of Kiva funds. Kiva and the Trustees shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such screening or selection of Borrowers, and you shall hold Kiva and the Trustees harmless from any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from such screening and selection of Borrowers.

				<div class="small-12 xlarge-8 columns">
					<p>
						<strong>1.5<span class="long-tab"></span>Loan Collection and Repayment.</strong> Partner Loans are repaid by Borrowers to the Field Partners. Generally, as a Borrower repays a Loan, the respective Field Partner will post a record to the Website of such repayments actually received by the Field Partner, and it is the responsibility and obligation of the applicable Field Partner to pay over such collected Loan repayments to Kiva. In some cases (for example, for Loans in India), the records of repayments are not posted on the Website as the Borrowers repay the Loans, as a result of certain system and country regulatory constraints. Direct Loans are repaid directly by Borrowers to Kiva, without facilitation by a Field Partner. Repayments may be made in periodic installments, depending on the terms of the applicable Loan. In some cases (for example, for Loans in India), repayments may only be provided at the end of a fixed term (for example, after 43 months), as a result of certain system and country regulatory constraints. Except as may be provided in Section 1.2 (Guest Checkout), Section 1.6 ("Principal Loss Scenarios") or Kiva’s <router-link to="/legal/promo-terms-of-use-february-2020">
							Promotional Lending Terms and Conditions
						</router-link>, Kiva commits to pay to Lenders on a pro rata basis (in accordance with the amounts loaned by each such Lender to a given Borrower) amounts equivalent to the repayments actually received by Kiva from such Borrower (whether directly from the Borrower or from a Field Partner). Repaid amounts will show as Kiva Credit in your account, but technically speaking these funds (which reflect amounts Kiva owes to you) are held by Kiva until you instruct us to (a) use the amounts repaid to make new Loans through your Kiva account, or (b) pay you an equivalent amount by requesting a withdrawal. Distributions to Lenders may, in Kiva's sole discretion, be made periodically or in one lump sum once 100% of all Loan proceeds for a particular Loan have been received by Kiva. Furthermore, please note that timing of distributions to Lenders may vary and may be materially impacted because of circumstances that, in Kiva's judgment, require Kiva to conduct further reviews with respect to the collected repayments (for example, to resolve issues regarding accuracy of repayment amounts and corresponding data, or for other issues). If, for any reason, a given Field Partner is unable to collect Partner Loan repayments directly from the Borrower(s) or if Kiva, for any reason, is unable to collect Loan repayments directly from a Field Partner or a Borrower, repayment of your Loan amounts could be at risk of partial or total delay or non-repayment and a loss of some or all of your principal could occur. You hereby acknowledge and agree that neither Field Partners nor Borrowers will have direct contractual obligation or liability to pay you any principal and that Kiva is only obligated to repay such Loan principal to the extent actually received by Kiva from a Field Partner or a Borrower (subject to the conditions noted above). None of Kiva, its Field Partners or any Borrower will have any obligation to pay interest on the Loan or other fees or amounts (other than as expressly set forth above) to you or any other Lender in connection with any Loan you make. However, you should note that in some cases Kiva charges service fees to Field Partners and Direct Loan Borrowers, and Field Partners generally also charge interest and fees to Borrowers.

					<p>
						<strong>Basically,</strong><br>
						This section explains how loan repayment works. After we receive a repayment on one of your loans, we will pay you and the other lenders back in proportion to how much everyone lent. You can also choose to use repaid amounts to make new loans. If a borrower or Field Partner doesn’t send repayments to Kiva as expected, you won’t get your money back. You don’t have the right to seek repayments directly from Field Partners or borrowers.

						<strong>1.6<span class="long-tab"></span>Principal Loss Scenarios.</strong> Kiva will generally deem a Loan to be in default if Kiva determines that collection of funds for such Loan is doubtful or the cumulative amount repaid as of a quarterly reconciliation is less than the amount expected as of six (6) months to one (1) year prior, although case by case differences may exist based on pending prospects for repayment of the Loan and depending on country context and related system and regulatory constraints. You understand and hereby consent (without any prior notice thereof) to any restructuring of the repayment plan for your Loan(s) and/or, in Kiva's sole discretion, any extension of the length of the term of your Loan(s) in order to increase the chances that your Loan(s) will be repaid in whole or in part. In cases where a Loan is in default, and subject to the distribution timing provisions noted in Section 1.4 (Loan Collection and Repayment) above, each applicable Lender will have the option to recover a portion of whatever principal has been repaid up to that point.

						Kiva has guidelines for when to declare a loan in default (meaning we believe the loan is not going to be repaid). We may decide it’s better not to follow these guidelines in some cases. For instance, while we won’t change a loan’s repayment terms on the Kiva website, we may nevertheless allow a borrower or Field Partner more time if we think it will increase the chance of repayment.

						For Partner Loans made in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, Kiva gives Field Partners the option to have Lenders bear the risk of principal losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Field Partners may require Lenders to bear any losses due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency in which the Loan was made. The Loan profile for each Partner Loan on the Website specifies whether the applicable Field Partner will cover some or all losses from currency fluctuations, or whether Lenders will be required to bear the risk of currency exchange rate losses. If there are currency exchange rate gains during the course of a Loan, such gains will first be used to offset any exchange rate losses on that same Loan, and any gains above the original Loan amount will be used by Kiva to further its charitable purposes (for example, funding future Loans or covering Kiva's operating expenses).

					<p>
						<strong>Basically,</strong><br>
						In addition to loan defaults, you may lose money because of changing currency exchange rates. Kiva loans are made in U.S. dollars, but Field Partners often distribute the money to borrowers in their local currency. Sometimes local currency becomes less valuable during the term of a loan. This means that by the time a borrower repays his or her loan, it might equal less than the original loan amount when it’s converted back to U.S. dollars.

Funds you donate to Kiva’s operations are eligible for tax deductibility in the United States. You acknowledge, however, that making a Loan on the Website does not constitute a charitable donation, and therefore you are not eligible to receive a tax deduction for any funds lent to a Borrower through the Website. For avoidance of doubt, if you sign up for Auto Deposit or Subscription Lending (see Section 1.8), the funds automatically deposited to your account will be not be eligible for tax deductibility unless and until you donate them to Kiva.

Kiva has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any Loan you might make.

						<strong>1.11<span class="long-tab"></span>User Account Inactivity; Instructions for Auto-Donation of Funds to Kiva or Auto-Withdrawal Return of Funds to User; Potential Escheatment of Funds.</strong> Kiva welcomes its Users' active participation in the Kiva Program. However, there may be occasions when a User becomes "inactive" for an extended period of time – i.e., a User does not log in to his or her Kiva account (or otherwise indicate to Kiva a desire to keep the account active – for example, through a phone or email communication with Kiva or by taking advantage of embedded response features, such as a click-response button in an email or other electronic communication from Kiva) or there are no credits/withdrawals made to such User's account (including lending and repayment activity from both manual and Auto-Loans). Therefore, Kiva has implemented a Website feature pursuant to which you may instruct Kiva in advance as to how you wish any remaining payments owed to you to be handled in the event your account were to become inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months – namely, whether in such a case of User inactivity, you (i) wish to automatically donate such funds to Kiva's general operating expenses to further Kiva's philanthropic mission or (ii) wish for Kiva to pay any amounts owed to you via Kiva's standard account withdrawal process. In addition, in such cases of User inactivity, Kiva may elect to automatically terminate the inactive User account.

						<u>For all other Users:</u> you will upon registration on the Website automatically be opted-in to instructing Kiva to auto-convert any remaining amounts owed to you (in connection with Loan repayments) to a donation to Kiva's general operating expenses to further Kiva's philanthropic mission if your account becomes inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months. Please note that you are free to change this pre-set option in your discretion and at any time in advance (although you understand any funds that have been auto-donated based on the then-existing preference setting shall not be revocable once the auto-donation has taken place).

						If your Kiva account has no activity for 2 years, it will become inactive and we reserve the right to close it. You can go to your account settings to let us know ahead of time what we should do with any money we still owe you if this happens.

In such a case, Kiva will determine your residency based on the state listed in your mailing address information that may have previously been made available to us. If your address is unknown or is outside of the USA, Kiva may then find it is appropriate to forward (escheat) your funds to the State of California. If your funds are escheated to a state authority, you would have to contact the relevant state's unclaimed property administrator to reclaim such funds.

			<div class="row summary-row">
				<div class="small-12 xlarge-8 columns">
					<p>
						This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its choice of law or conflict of law provisions. If any dispute arises between you and Kiva, including, without limitation, any dispute arising from or relating to the Website or the Program, you agree that all such disputes will be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration, in accordance with the then existing commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco if the amount claimed is greater than $100 and otherwise over the telephone or in another city in which Kiva is located. The arbitration shall be heard and adjudicated by one arbitrator to be selected by you and Kiva. Any award will be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to judicial review provided by California statute, and a judgment rendered on the arbitration award can be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Kiva may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, as may be necessary to preserve rights pending the completion of arbitration and Kiva may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, or another court of competent jurisdiction, at any time against any violations of Section 2 (Acceptable Use) or Section 3 (Proprietary Rights) of this Agreement.
					</p>

					<p>
						TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BY AGREEING TO SUBMIT ALL DISPUTES TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU AND KIVA HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY OR COURT TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONTEMPLATED USE HEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED ABOVE.
