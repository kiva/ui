			</p>
			<p>
				By using the Kiva API provided by Kiva Microfunds (“Kiva”), you (the “Licensee”)
				agree to this Developer Terms of Service (“Agreement”). The following
				are incorporated by reference into this Agreement:
				(a) the Kiva Terms of Use (located at http://www.kiva.org/legal/terms) and
				(b) the Kiva Privacy Policy (located at http://www.kiva.org/legal/privacy).
				In the event of any irreconcilable conflict between this Agreement and
				any of the Kiva Terms of Use or Kiva Privacy Policy, the provisions of
				this Agreement shall govern. This Agreement may be modified by Kiva in
				its sole discretion from time to time and such modifications shall
				automatically become part of this Agreement and shall be effective
				once posted by Kiva on the Kiva Website (as indicated by the posted
				update date). Your License will be subject to any such modifications.
				You should review the Website and this Agreement from time to time for
				any modifications. If you do not agree with any such modifications,
				please immediately terminate your use of the Licensed API (as defined below),
				as outlined in Section 11 below.

			<h2>2. Grant of License</h2>

				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->
				Subject to Licensee’s full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Kiva grants Licensee a non-exclusive, revocable, nonsublicensable, nontransferable license to use the Kiva API and API Materials (collectively referred to as the “Licensed API”) to develop, reproduce and distribute non-commercial applications for the Permitted Purpose (“Developed Applications”). Licensee may not use the Licensed API or any Kiva data, information or materials for any other purpose (including without limitation any commercial purpose) other than the Permitted Purpose without Kiva’s prior written consent. Further, under no circumstances will Licensee benefit commercially or financially from a Developed Application or any Kiva information, data or materials. For the sake of clarity, the sale of advertising on a website where a Developed Application is hosted shall not alone constitute a commercial use under this Agreement, provided that the advertising is not integrated within the Developed Application itself. Further, a Developed Application may not be used to sell advertising and may not be used to promote the sale of advertising in any way.
			</p>
			<p>
				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->
				Licensee may not use the Licensed API for activities that violate any law, statute, ordinance or regulation or this Agreement.

In addition, for purposes of illustration and without limitation, Licensee shall not: (a) misrepresent in any way data, information or materials about or relating to a loan, lender, borrower or Kiva partner, individually or in the aggregate (irrespective of whether such misrepresentation is due to Licensee’ intentional conduct, error or ignorance) and/or (b) misrepresent Licensee’s identity in connection with the Licensed API and Developed Application, including without limitation by soliciting or attempting to solicit any data, information or materials under the pretense of being Kiva. Furthermore, Licensee shall not solicit or attempt to solicit any data, information or materials on behalf of Kiva, unless expressly required by Kiva (for example, to implement the functionality required in Section 5(b) below for Kiva to obtain consent from a user to share certain data about such user with Licensee and the Developed Application), and Licensee shall clearly and prominently communicate to its users that all other data, information and materials collected by Licensee and Licensee’s Developed Application is not on behalf of Kiva.
			</p>
			<h2>3. Proprietary Rights</h2>
			<p>
				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->

				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->
				Except as expressly and unambiguously authorized under this Agreement, Licensee may not (a) copy, rent, lease, sell, transfer, assign, sublicense, disassemble, reverse engineer or decompile (except to the limited extent expressly required by applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of the Licensed API, or (b) otherwise use the Licensed API on behalf of any third party (other than the intended end users of Licensee’s Developed Application, as permitted under this Agreement). Subject to Licensee’s full compliance with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Kiva grants Licensee a non-exclusive, revocable, nonsublicensable, nontransferable license during the term of this Agreement to display the Kiva trade names, trademarks, service marks, and logos (collectively, “Kiva API Marks”), if any, that Kiva makes available to Licensee, in Kiva’s sole discretion, to promote or advertise Licensee’s integration of the Kiva API in Licensee’s Developed Application. Licensee agrees that Licensee’s use and display of Kiva API Marks will at all times be consistent with branding guidelines provided by Kiva to Licensee and shall not identify or attempt to identify any product or Developed Application as being endorsed, approved by or produced by Kiva. No rights or licenses are granted except as expressly and unambiguously set forth herein.
			</p>

Licensee must not include functionality that proxies, requests or collects Kiva usernames or passwords. Licensee must not circumvent intended limitations on Kiva Website features and functionality. Licensee will only request API Materials that Licensee needs to operate its Developed Application. Licensee will not directly or indirectly transfer or share any API Materials, including without limitation lender data or usernames, to (or use such API Materials in connection with) any third party (other than the intended end users of Licensee’s Developed Application, as permitted under this Agreement). Licensee is responsible for all activities that occur in connection with Licensee’s access or right to access the Licensed API. Licensee must not combine API Materials with other data, information or materials obtained from Kiva or any Kiva Website through any means outside the Kiva API, including without limitation scraping Kiva Websites, except through unexpired data snapshots provided by Kiva at build.kiva.org and as may be otherwise expressly permitted by Kiva in writing. If Licensee requires data, information or materials from Kiva or any Kiva Website that is not provided through the Kiva API or unexpired data snapshots, please contact build_kiva@kiva.org. Licensee shall not interfere with or disrupt the Kiva API, Kiva Websites or other Kiva services, products and systems. Kiva reserves the right, in Kiva’s sole discretion, at any time to terminate the Kiva API, limit the number of network calls that Licensee’s Developed Application may make via the Kiva API, and change features of the Kiva API, including without limitation the API Materials that may be accessed.

			<h2>5. Conditions to Non-Public Data; Write Ability</h2>
			<p>
				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->
				If Licensee has access to or has the right to access any Kiva API that grants access or read rights to any API Materials that are not otherwise available to the general public on the Website (e.g., data returned from end-points starting with https://api.kivaws.org/v1/my or https://api.kivaws.org/partner) (“Non-Public Data”), or granting the ability to write any data, information or materials from or to Kiva accounts or Kiva Websites through the Licensed API (collectively, “Non-Public Functionality”), Licensee must comply with the following provisions as a condition to Licensee’s right to access the Non-Public Functionality and Non-Public Data.

Such consent will be obtained in connection with the user’s first use of the Developed Application, but if the capabilities of the Developed Application are materially expanded, the consent of such user shall be obtained prior to the user’s additional use of the Developed Application. Licensee shall strictly comply with the scope of express consent that the applicable user has granted. A user may revoke its consent at any time by logging into the user’s account on the applicable Kiva Website or by contacting Kiva, and Licensee shall immediately respect any such revocation. Licensee shall not obfuscate or hide any Kiva functionality, including without limitation consent or authorization flows.

Licensee shall use Licensee’s best efforts to use and display the most up-to-date API Materials in or through Licensee’s Developed Application. Licensee shall not use the API Materials for any purpose outside of the Developed Application. Licensee will delete all data, materials or information that Licensee received from Kiva concerning any person or entity if such person or entity asks Licensee to do so, and Licensee will provide an easily accessible mechanism for making such a request.
			</p>
			<p>
				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->
				(d)	Licensee shall maintain its own terms of service and privacy policy applicable to users of such Developed Application (collectively, “Licensee Terms”), which Licensee Terms shall specify, at a minimum, what data Licensee and the Developed Application collect and how Licensee and the Developed Application use, display, share, transfer and dispose of such data.

			</p>
			<h2>6. Additional Licensee Obligations</h2>
			<p>
				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->
				Licensee agrees: (a) that its Developed Application will preserve the dignity of all persons, including without limitation persons seeking loans represented, described or listed on the Kiva Websites, (b) that its Developed Application will clearly indicate that such Developed Application was not developed by Kiva and is not endorsed by Kiva, and (c) that any images obtained from or through the Licensed API and used in a Developed Application will be linked via hyperlink to the loan detail page (or original image if not a loan image) on Kiva’s image servers unless such linking is not technically feasible. License further agrees to preserve (and not obscure or cover) all copyright notices and other proprietary rights notices on content that Kiva makes available to Licensee via the Licensed API and to provide proper attribution for all such content. For purposes of illustration and without limitation, if, for example, Licensee develops an application that provides a graph using data provided by Kiva, Licensee must accurately state that the data Licensee used comes from Kiva. Licensee shall assist Kiva in verifying Licensee’s compliance with this Agreement by providing Kiva information about Licensee’s Developed Application, including without limitation providing Kiva access to such Developed Application and materials related to the Developed Application. Licensee shall also ensure that, when posting a basket to the Kiva site via the Developed Application, the suggested optional donation amount of 15% is preserved.

If any dispute arises between Licensee and Kiva, including, without limitation, any dispute arising from or relating to the Kiva API, Licensed API and any Developed Application, Licensee agrees that all such disputes will be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration, in accordance with the then existing commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco if the amount claimed is greater than $100 and otherwise over the telephone or in another city in which Kiva is located. The arbitration shall be heard and adjudicated by one arbitrator to be selected by Licensee and Kiva. Any award will be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to judicial review provided by California statute, and a judgment rendered on the arbitration award can be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Licensee or Kiva may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, as may be necessary to preserve rights pending the completion of arbitration and Kiva may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, or another court of competent jurisdiction, at any time against any violations of Sections 2 through 6.

			</p>
			<h2>15. Miscellaneous</h2>
			<p>
				<!-- eslint-disable-next-line max-len -->
				This Agreement constitutes the complete and entire agreement between Licensee and Kiva pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous written or oral agreements or understandings with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a writing executed by Kiva. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable for any reason, that provision of the Agreement will be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable or will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of Kiva to act with respect to a breach of this Agreement by Licensee or others does not constitute a waiver and shall not limit Kiva’s rights with respect to such breach or any subsequent breaches. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement by Kiva will be effective only if in writing and signed by Kiva. This Agreement is personal to Licensee and may not be assigned or transferred for any reason whatsoever (including without limitation, by operation of law, merger, reorganization, or as a result of an acquisition or change of control involving Licensee) without Kiva’s prior written consent and any action or conduct in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void and without effect. Kiva expressly reserves the right to assign this Agreement and to delegate any of its obligations hereunder.
